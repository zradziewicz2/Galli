It’s part of the Morrison-Golden Fossil Areas National Natural Landmark and was where some of the first Stegosaurus and other dinosaur bones were discovered in the late 1800s, with the tracksite now ranked among the top in North America. The ridge features more than 300 fossil tracks, interpretive signs, and opportunities to learn about both Jurassic and Cretaceous-era life",
